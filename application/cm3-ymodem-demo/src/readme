This example show the usage of  ymodem transfer and booting from ddr memory.


Uses the ymodem app to downlaod the binary file to the ddr memory.
save the downlaoded fiel into the spi flash memory
spi flash memory sector 0 is used as a directory with file infomation .

to boot from flash memory via ddr, initially the controller reads from the sector 0 to check for the
valid file in spi flash, once found, laod the content from spi flash to the ddr location 0xa0000.
then use the boot_from_ddr() to execute from ddr.

ymodem app is modified to use the file_t for capturing the file name an file_sie, fil_bytes info directly from ymodem app and 
later used to write into the spi file directory.


Ymodem Application for fabric IP version for M3.

M3 is runnign at 50Mhz , DDR is enabled and fabric IPs are used . Systick timer is used for delay degenrations.

Use option 'u' to upload the fiel via Ymodem to the DDR memroy location
option 's' to save this fiel to the spi flash memory.
option 'm' display teh  uploaded fiel fro mthe DDR location
option 'd'  reads the data from spi flash memory and display in hexview.


adjust the delay_ms(50) inside the spli_flash_write funtion to make sure that that only 
sufficient delay between erase cycles. this needs to be edited if the processor frequency ismodified or the systick
config value is changed. delay_ms(50) is when systick value is configured with  systick_load  = SystemCoreClock/100 ;
use delay_ms(500) when the systick_load  = SystemCoreClock


following are the difference between the mss version and fabric IP version 

systick_config()

{
 uint32_t systick_load;
 SystemCoreClockUpdate();
 systick_load  = SystemCoreClock/100 ; 
 SysTick_Config(systick_load);
 
 }
 
 
 along with this the delay inside the uart_getchar is changed to following.
 original time was 1000 ( 1 second) changed to 5000
 
 else if(timeout > 0) /* time limited mode */
    {
        start_time = g_10ms_count; /* record starting point */
        timeout *= 5000;           /* Convert timeout to ms */
